# Mad Lib
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for
words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them
into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and
an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

### **Example Output**

>`Enter a verb:`

>`Enter an adjective:`

### **Constraints**
- Use a single output statement for this program.
- If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it
to build up the output.
