# Pizza Party
Division isn’t always exact, and sometimes you’ll write programs that will need
to deal with the leftovers as a whole number instead of a decimal.

Write a program to evenly divide pizzas. Prompt for the number of people, the
number of pizzas, and the number of slices per pizza. Ensure that the number of
pieces comes out even. Display the number of pieces of pizza each person should
get. If there are leftovers, show the number of leftover pieces.

### **Example Output**
