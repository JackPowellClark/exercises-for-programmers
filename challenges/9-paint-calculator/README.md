# Paint Calculator
Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather
than follow standard rounding rules.

Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for
the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the
number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

### **Example Output**
>`What is the length of the room in feet?`

[user inputs length of room]

>`What is the width of the room in feet?`

[user inputs width of room]

>`You will need to purchase 2 gallons of paint to cover 360 square feet.`

### **Constraint**
- You canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must round up to the next whole
gallon.
- Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
- Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.
